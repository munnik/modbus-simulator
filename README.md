# MODBUS simulator and plugin
To get some data into the server you can setup the modbus simulator in this repository by following the instructions in `c32simulator.service`, and then installing and configuring the modbus plugin with the instructions [here](https://github.com/codekilo/signalk-modbus-plugin). The example configuration file in that repository is already setup for the c32simulator.
